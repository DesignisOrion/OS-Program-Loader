# About

Have you ever been lazy and didn't feel like clicking on all the apps to open when first arriving to your workstation?

OS Program Loader will allow you to open multiple programs at once by selecting the options within the GUI.

## What did I learn

```
During this project, I was able to learn more about the package "tkinter", "filedialog" and "os".
```

```
The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)
```

```
The tkinter.filedialog module provides classes and factory functions for creating file/directory selection windows.
```

```
The os module allows you to access any operating system used.
```

## What did I use

Python 3

### Installing Python3

```
Go to https://www.python.org/ and download the latest version of Python. I am currently using Python 3.8.
```

or

```
Open terminal / CLI. Type "pip install python"
```
